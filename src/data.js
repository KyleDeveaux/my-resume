    date: "Aug - April 2023",
    objective:
      "The Florida Power & Light (FPL) company embarked on an initiative to bolster the safety measures for their workers, focusing on developing a sophisticated system capable of detecting vehicles encroaching on designated maintenance zones. As the leader of Team 18, I meticulously organized and coordinated with my team through structured sprints, ensuring that we met our objectives within the set deadlines. My primary responsibilities revolved around spearheading both the frontend and backend development of the project, enabling the integration of various technologies and facilitating seamless communication within the team to ensure the realization of our goals. Together we successfully achieved the goals outlined by FPL by adeptly applying cutting-edge technologies. We integrated a microcontroller with a lidar sensor, enabling the real-time monitoring and tracking of moving vehicles. My partner and I developed a robust backend system, ensuring seamless data transmission to a cloud-based server, where it was securely stored and relayed to the frontend interface that I also chiefly designed and implemented.",
    lesson: "During this project, I deepened my knowledge of React and JavaScript, honing my skills in crafting responsive interfaces. I familiarized myself with MongoDB for effective database management and AWS for secure cloud solutions. Exploring Python, I tackled backend challenges and mastered the creation and utilization of APIs, crucial for real-time data transfer. Additionally, I gained insights into embedded systems, learning to integrate microcontrollers with sensors for real-time monitoring. This experience was pivotal in broadening my technical skill set and preparing me for future technological endeavors.",
